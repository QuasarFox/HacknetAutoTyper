# HacknetAutoTyper
# This program was made to beat the current WR in the 1337 Category of Hacknet.
# Inspired by BobTheBob's and Pastillage/Rizlim's heart-finding tools, but wrote the code all myself (with the help of stackoverflow :P).
# 
# This program searches for the porthack.heart IP in a savegame, then creates 2 global hotkeys to type the commands out faster.
# No need to copy-paste anything since it gets written automatically with the press of the hotkey.
# After BobTheBob's WR Tool didn't work at all for me (because the savegame path was coded in), I made mine more customizable so others could use it aswell.
# The default path for my PC is always there when you start the program, but you can change it and the program will look at the specified place instead.
# I wanted to make the hotkeys changable aswell but was too lazy in the end, maybe I'll update it at some point.

# OSXBoot.txt (just for fun, was messing around with the files, didn't have any impact on the time)
# Both these files are in the Hacknet/Content/ folder in the gamefiles.
